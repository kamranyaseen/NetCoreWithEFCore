# NetCoreWithEFCore
This web application uses modern UI and RESTful API, and as long as interfaces are the same, could be easily swapped out with a different application. RESTful API written in loosely coupled manner to keep the maintenance easier, and unit tests included to cover the logic implemented. The application requires minimal configuration to start.

URLs:
*	Launching the application from Visual Studio will open: http://localhost:19108/ 
*	Swagger UI for RESTful API testing can be found here: http://localhost:19108/swagger/ui/
